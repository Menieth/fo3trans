{200}{}{You see an old, kindly looking fellow.}
{210}{}{It's Doc Jubilee.}
{210}{}{He's an old man with a snow-white beard and a slightly blank stare.}

{2000}{}{Welcome to the Doctor Jubilee's humble clinic. How can I help you?}
{2010}{}{I need a doctor.}
{2020}{}{I am quite interested into medicine myself, and this is the reason I am visiting you today. My hopes are that you could share some of your knowledge and experience with me...}
{2030}{}{Nothing, bye.}
{3000}{}{I think I can cure what ails ya. It's gonna cost you @lex price@$ bucks.}
{3010}{}{Well... all right. That sounds fair.}
{3020}{}{Changed my mind. I'll be back later.}
{4000}{}{Alright, lie down. This may take a while.}
{4010}{}{Sure thing, Doc.}
{5000}{}{That should do it. Good luck, youngster.}
{6000}{}{Oh, a colleague! It is not that I meet colleagues every day, you know... The reason more to say that I am very pleased to have you here. So, what did you want us to talk about then?}
{6010}{}{I was hoping you can show me how to perform simple surgeries and... [You explain what you need]}
{6020}{}{Well, I was interested in more complex methods of saving human lives, which would consider... [You explain him what you need]}
{6030}{}{I, erhm... Not quite sure where to start from. Maybe I should drop a little bit later. [Leave]}
{7000}{}{Sure, sure... We can already arrange something, I guess. But I would like to have something in return, a kind of compensation for my time and work. It's not that I'm trying to earn something out of this, but a help from a colleague like you would be quite appreciated. I'll keep it short then -- I would need $1500 for a short lesson or $3000 for one with more detail. Please, let me know when you have it.}
{7010}{}{You don't have to worry, my appreciated colleague, I have $1500 right here! [You give him $1500]}
{7020}{}{You don't have to worry, my appreciated colleague, I have $3000 right here! [You give him $3000]}
{7030}{}{Well, I should start gathering some healing herbs then. See you later, doctor Jubilee!}
{8000}{}{Excellent! Then we should waste no more time, let's begin... [Doctor Jubilee starts to show you his healing and surgery methods. After the session, you get a book from him.]}
{8010}{}{Thank you very much, doctor Jubilee! I will do my best to put this knowledge to a good use, I assure you. Have a nice day!}
