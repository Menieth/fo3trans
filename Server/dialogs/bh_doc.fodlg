{2060}{}{Forget it. Sorry.}
{3000}{}{::wheeze:: Hi there. Iďż˝m Doc Holliday. How can I help you?}
{3010}{}{Ouchie!}
{4000}{}{What do I do here? Youďż˝re in a hospital. Iďż˝m wearing a doctorďż˝s coat. Iďż˝m covered with blood. There are sharp, pointy things lying all around. Either Iďż˝m a successful killer or a fair doctor. Take your pick.}
{4010}{}{I guess I can call you a doctor.}
{4020}{}{Donďż˝t get smart with me, old man.}
{4030}{}{A really good doctor would get blood all over himself.}
{5000}{}{Letďż˝s see. I was born here years ago. Place was just getting started. I picked up when I was a teen and tooled around the place for a while. Met a woman. Fell in love. She died of sickness. I decided then that I was going to become a doctor.}
{5010}{}{Yeah? Go on.}
{5020}{}{We were talking about Broken Hills, not your history.}
{6000}{}{Youďż˝d be surprised what people say when theyďż˝re in pain.}
{6010}{}{Oh yeah? Like what?}
{6020}{}{I changed my mind. Iďż˝d rather ask other questions.}
{7000}{}{You been seeing some action? I remember back when I was a little spitfire. Got plenty of holes in me, too. This misadventure will cost you $@lex price@.}
{7010}{}{Can't afford it. Sorry.}
{7020}{}{Iďż˝ll pay.}
{7030}{}{Maybe later. Goodbye, Doc.}
{8000}{}{Itďż˝s been a pleasure.}
{8010}{}{Thanks.}
{9000}{}{Sorry kid, I wish I could help you, I really could.}
{9010}{}{Don't worry about it, I've got some more questions.}
{9020}{}{Eaaii, caauee.}
{10000}{}{::wheeze:: Are you hurt? Let me take a look at that. Do you have money?}
{10010}{}{Mo-ney?}
{10020}{}{Sowee.}
{11000}{}{Let me take a look at your bag. (he looks through your bag and takes something) Okay. Now, this may hurt a little bit.}
{11010}{}{Hurt?}
{12000}{}{Yes. Nowďż˝ There! Weďż˝re done. Good luck to you, okay? Donďż˝t get hurt!}
{12010}{}{Tanks!}
{13000}{}{Thatďż˝s right. Iďż˝m a doctor. Good to see that intelligence is alive and well in the post-nuclear world.}
{13010}{}{Ha! And itďż˝s kicking around inside a 70-year-old man!}
{13020}{}{I donďż˝t want to be taking shit from you, old man.}
{13030}{}{Ummm.. Yeah. I had more questions.}
{13040}{}{Bye.}
{14000}{}{Threaten the only doctor in town. Good thinking. ::cough:: Friend, if you want something, you can ask politely. Otherwise, get the hell out of my hospital.}
{14010}{}{Bite me, old man. Get ready to die.}
{14020}{}{Yeah. Whatever.}
{14030}{}{Sorry. Bad day.}
{14040}{}{I was just kidding around.}
{15000}{}{Stripling,  you have a lot to learn about respect.}
{15010}{}{Yeah, all right.}
{15020}{}{Yeah, whatever. I'm leaving.}
{16000}{}{(You can see a glint of laughter in his eyes behind his glasses.) Donďż˝t see it too many other places these days. The young of the world, for exampleďż˝}
{16010}{}{Hey!}

{16040}{}{Yeah, yeah, yeahďż˝ I gotta go.}
{17000}{}{Relax, kid. Just joking around with you.}
{17010}{}{Yeah, I know. Soďż˝ ummmďż˝ bye.}
{18000}{}{ďż˝ and what we refuse to tell you little bastards! (he bursts out laughing) Kid, you're a riot. Come back anytime.}
{18010}{}{I had some other questions.}
{18020}{}{Thanks. Iďż˝ll see you around.}
{19000}{}{Surprisingly little. Sorry, but when Iďż˝m concentrating on healing someone, I donďż˝t usually pay attention to their innermost secrets.}
{19010}{}{Oh. Will you answer more questions?}
{20000}{}{So then I traveled to San Francisco and studied under the Chinese thereďż˝ an old gentleman by the name of Mr. Fung taught me everything I know about medicine. He also taught me some wisdom.}
{20010}{}{So then what happened?}
{20020}{}{And this ties into Broken Hills how?}
{21000}{}{Then, I came back here and watched the old sheriff, Marcus. build the town from the shanties I remember from my youth into the "sprawling metropolis" you see before you. I saw people attracted by promises of wealth. I saw people grow up and die. I saw the currents of history.}
{21010}{}{So that meansďż˝}
{22000}{}{That means that I donďż˝t know most of the new people these days. Most of my memories are just that -- memories.}
{22010}{}{Oh. Well, thanks for the story.}
{22020}{}{You jerk! You made me wait that long for nothing?}
{23000}{}{No, thank you for listening to me ramble. Take care of yourself, kid.}
{23010}{}{Thanks! So anywayďż˝}
{23020}{}{Thanks. So long!}
{24000}{}{Yeah. Hope it was worth it! (he cackles)}
{24010}{}{No. Not really. Tell me something else.}
{24020}{}{No. You shriveled old jerk. Bye.}
{25000}{}{What do you want now?}
{25010}{}{Iďż˝m hurt and need healing.}
{25020}{}{What do you do here?}
{25030}{}{Tell me about the town.}
{25040}{}{Any gossip?}
{25050}{}{Just sell me some stimpacks.}
{25060}{}{Forget it. Sorry.}
{26000}{}{Iďż˝m getting to that! Kids these daysďż˝ so impatient.}
{26010}{}{Sorry. Go on.}
{26020}{}{This sucks. Iďż˝m outta here.}
{27000}{}{I've heard about you. I don't want you causing any trouble in my clinic, so I'm gonna be asking you to leave, fella.}
{27010}{}{Fuck you, then.}
{28000}{}{Sorry, clinic's, uh.. closed today!@@Sorry, I can't do anything for your face.@@Please, you're scaring my patients.@@I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I'm so sorry.}
