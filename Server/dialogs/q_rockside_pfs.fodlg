{2000}{}{Good day, dear resident. Here you can pass Vault Tec P.F.S. ( Prepare For Surface ) test. Are you ready for your examination?}
{2010}{}{Alright, I guess I am ready.}
{2020}{}{PFS? What is it?}
{2030}{}{Wait... I don't remember anything. I need to get in contact  with overseer. I...}
{2040}{}{Later maybe.}
{3000}{}{P. F. S. is a special test of Vault Tec that will help us to understand either you are ready to leave your Vault!}
{3010}{}{Hah... I see.}
{3020}{}{Alright, then lets do it.}
{4000}{}{bzzzzt... Error...Error...}
{5000}{}{Good! So lets get started, shall we? First question:

You're heading to the nearest Vault-Tec office and suddenly, see a man, who claims that he is the President of the United States. He wears an expensive suit and even has a special president's badge. What will you do?

}
{5010}{}{Shoot him down.}
{5020}{}{Greet and listen to him.}
{5030}{}{Shake his hand... Oh damn it is such an honor.}
{5040}{}{Wait wha...?}
{6000}{}{Great! Lets continue.

Suddenly, US Army soldiers met you at your path. They demand you give them all that you have. What will you do?}
{6010}{}{Yell at them.}
{6020}{}{Politely tell them that it is my own property.}
{6030}{}{Give them everything they want.}
{6040}{}{How is it even connected to...?}
{7000}{}{Amazing! Now imagine that you got a message on your pip boy. The message warns you about upcoming nuclear rocket! What company will you call to save your life?}
{7010}{}{Vault Tec}
{7020}{}{Vault Tec I guess...}
{7030}{}{Eeehm... Vault Tec?}
{7040}{}{That must be Vault Tec.}
{7050}{}{Go- fuck- yourse...}
{8000}{}{Great job, resident! It seems like you are fully ready to leave this Vault! Don't worry, soon the government forces will finally arrive and let you free - so you will see new fantastic America! The opening date will happen in 2104 and today is... 2242... Error... error...}
{8010}{}{Hey! Hey! Ah crap...}
{9000}{}{Wrong! The REAL President would led our country from his special high-command base, in safety and calmness! How could you listen to some fool right in the middle of nowhere?!}
{9010}{}{The fuck is...?}
{10000}{}{It's real American defenders and patriots! How could you refuse to give them last pieces of food, even if you starving?!}
{10010}{}{You must be kidding...}
{11000}{}{Fantastic! Now imagine that in a middle of a desert you've met a person who claims that he is a Vault Tec representer! He wears a special suit and even has a special badge with him. What will you do?}
{11010}{}{Shoot him down.}
{11020}{}{Run away.}
{11030}{}{Greet and listen to him.}
{12000}{}{Oh no! How can you actually be so unpleasant towards a Vault Tec representer? He even has a badge with him! Isn't it enough for you to be sure that he is not some fake?}
{12010}{}{Who even made this crap?!}
